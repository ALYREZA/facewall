{"name":"Facewall","tagline":"","body":"# Facewall\r\n\r\nAn open-source version of HubSpot's Facewall and Facewall game. __More information coming soon.__\r\n\r\n## Configuring\r\n\r\n- First thing you'll want to do is update the following files:\r\n    - [config.coffee](https://github.com/HubSpot/facewall/blob/master/config.coffee)\r\n    - [constants.coffee](https://github.com/HubSpot/facewall/blob/master/app/constants.coffee)\r\n\r\n- Next, you'll want to configure [employees.coffee](https://github.com/HubSpot/facewall/blob/master/app/collections/employees.coffee) with either a URL or `USER_JSON` string. The format of the JSON needs to be the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n   \"users\":[\r\n      {\r\n         \"id\": 1,\r\n         \"createdAt\": 1282254176000,\r\n         \"email\": \"aschwartz@hubspot.com\",\r\n         \"firstName\": \"Adam\",\r\n         \"lastName\": \"Schwartz\",\r\n         \"role\": \"Principal Software Engineer\"\r\n      },\r\n      // ...\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nFacewall is a [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch) app. To run it with no authentication simply run the following:\r\n\r\n    brunch watch --server -p PORT\r\n\r\nIf you want to use SSL, you'll additionally need to set up [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/index.html). See the [Stunnel README](https://github.com/HubSpot/facewall/blob/master/STUNNEL_README.md) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Deploying\r\n\r\nSee [Brunch's guide on deploying](http://brunch.io/#deploying).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
